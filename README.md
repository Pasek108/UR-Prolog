## About :dart:
These are my solutions to laboratory exercises carried out as part of the course "Języki i paradygmaty programowania" (Programming languages ​​and paradigms) in the Computer Science program at UR. 

The course covered the basics of the functional programming language Haskell ([UR-Haskell](https://github.com/Pasek108/UR-Haskell)) and the logic programming language Prolog. The acquired knowledge was tested in the form of a practical test.

- [ConTEXT Editor](https://www.contexteditor.org)
